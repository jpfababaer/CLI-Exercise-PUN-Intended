# RUBY-CLI-EXERCISE

This is a CLI exercise to record your workout exercises (pun intended). Use it to:
1) Record the type of exercise you did, the amount of sets and repetitions, as well as the weight you used. 
2) Review the list of exercises you did during your workout.
3) Crank up ONE push-up if you feel like it!

To start:
1. Run the ruby file ```app.rb ``` in the terminal.

- Ruby version: `3.2.1`
